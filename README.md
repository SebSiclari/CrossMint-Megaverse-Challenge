# Crossmint Megaverse Challenge

A TypeScript solution for the Crossmint Megaverse Challenge that creates a 2D space with various astral objects (POLYanets, SOLoons, and comETHs) by interacting with the Crossmint API.

## Overview

This project automates the creation of a megaverse map through the Crossmint API. It handles two phases:

- **Phase 1**: Creates a basic map with only POLYanets
- **Phase 2**: Creates a complex map including POLYanets, SOLoons (with colors), and comETHs (with directions)

## Features

- Fully automated map creation
- Rate limiting to handle API constraints
- Type-safe implementation using TypeScript
- Modular architecture with separate services for each entity type
- Error handling and logging
- Environment-based configuration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm or yarn
- A Crossmint candidate ID
